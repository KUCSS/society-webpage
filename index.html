<p>The <b>Kingston University Cyber Security Society</b> aims to provide a place for people to learn more about all things cyber security. We’ll also be running events to further knowledge and have fun whilst doing so!</p>
<p>We’ll be running events such as:</p>
<list>
  <ul>- Capture the flag (CTF) competitions</ul>
  <ul>- Talks from people in the profession (will be open to all)</ul>
  <ul>- Run study groups to help people both on and off of the Cyber Security courses</ul>
